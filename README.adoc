== HiveMQ DNS discovery plugin

This plugin can be used with any cloud environment / container
orchestration environment that supports service discovery using a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS[round-robin] A record.

The following environment variables or property keys should be used to
customize the discovery parameters.

If a properties file is provided (`dnsdiscovery.properties` in `conf/`
folder), the plugin will use the key-value pairs from this file and
reload the values on file changes.

The plugin will attempt to load the properties file first. If it does not
exist, the plugin will not attempt to reload the properties and instead
try to read from the environment variables on each iteration until
broker shutdown.

*Configuration options:*

|=======================================================================
|Environment Variable |Default value |property key |Meaning
|HIVEMQ_DNS_DISCOVERY_ADDRESS |- |discoveryAddress |Address providing the A
record for the usage as cluster node addresses
|HIVEMQ_DNS_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT |30 |resolutionTimeout |Wait time
for DNS resolution to complete
|=======================================================================

== Sample DNS record

The following list shows a sample round-robin A-record as expected and parsed by the
plugin:

....
$ dig tasks.hivemq

This record represents a 5 node cluster on an overlay network.

[[how-it-works]]
== How it works

This diagram shows how DNS discovery is generally implemented on container engines.

The components differ when using DNS discovery outside of container engine.
When using it in conjunction with DNSaaS solutions for example, the DNS entries will be created by the orchestration solution used instead.

image::dns-discovery-diagram.png[DNS discovery visualized]

The container engine provides a DNS server to the containers/pods for improved caching of DNS queries as well as additional functionality like service discovery and hostnames for the containers.

This DNS server is the main endpoint the DNS discovery plugin will communicate with. The DNS server responds with a predefined record which is created by the orchestration engine.
The record contains the list of containers/pods in the cluster, which HiveMQ will then use to discover the other nodes.

[[usage]]
== Usage

Most container orchestration environments support this type of discovery. See the following list for some examples:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services[Kubernetes]
* https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/service-links/#discovering-containers-on-the-same-service-or-stack[Docker Swarm]
* https://mesosphere.github.io/mesos-dns/[Mesos]
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#headless-services[Openshift]

To implement your own solution for this discovery method, you must either provide your HiveMQ deployment with

* a custom DNS record on your cloud provider's DNS service containing the addresses of your HiveMQ instances.
* an alternative DNS server included with the deployment, serving general DNS to the HiveMQ instances as well as providing a service discovery record.
